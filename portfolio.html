	<p>"The Beauty of the Sky" is a collage of images put together in representation of all of the sights the sky has to offer. I decided to make it extremely vibrant, to better capture the feeling of awe I get when I see sunsets. The fox aurora is a reference to the phrase "fox fires."</p>

	<p>This stop motion animation features a sketch of a cloaked creature coming to life and briefly exploring my desk. I cut out and taped pieces of its body, swapping them out when I needed to. The only materials I used were paper, tape, a cardboard stand, and a pencil.</p>

	<p>This video was filmed by Gary Dufner and edited by me. It shows Gary talking to himself, with a narrator occasionally explaining things. I used masking, audio effects, and a shape layer in order to make the finished piece.</p>
